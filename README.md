## Getting started
1. Regularls: Make sure you have installed on your local machine `nodeJs` `v22.3+` as a runtime environment, the package manager `npm` and `git`.

2. Database: Install and start [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) as your database service on your local machine or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) if you prefer a cloud-hosted database. Create a new database instance for the app.

3. Google Api: Login into our Google Console account or set one up and get your api key for [all Google Maps Platform APIs]([https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/start?utm_source=Docs_GS_Button&ref=https://developers.google.com/maps/&_gl=1*dbjcor*_ga*MjExNTg4MjQyMy4xNzIxNjUzODIw*_ga_NRWSTWS78N*MTcyNDQyOTY0OC45LjEuMTcyNDQyOTkzMS4wLjAuMA..)). Make sure afterwards to enable Geocoding and Places APIs in the Console.

## Install and run the app:

1. Fork this repo into your GitHub

2. Clone your fork onto your local machine using
   
   1. If you wish to load the project into a new directory, create one first
   
   2. In your terminal navigate into your desired directory for this project and load your forked repository to you local machine
      ```bash
      cd <your-directory-name>
      git clone <link_to_your_forked_repo>`
      ```

3. Install dependencies
   
   1. Navigate in your terminal into the `/server` directory and install dependencies from npm
      ```bash
      cd server
      npm i
      cd ..         # ! navigates back to root directory !
      ```
   
   2. Navigate in your terminal into the `/client` directory and install dependencies from npm
      ```bash
      cd client   
      npm i
      cd ..          # ! navigates back to root directory !
      ```

4. Setup environment variables
   1. Via your terminal, create a `.env` file in the `root` directory
      ```bash
      touch .env
      ```

   2. Add API key for Google Maps via the terminal
      ```bash
      echo "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY='your_api_key'" >> .env      # ! replace 'your_api_key' with your key created for all Google Maps APIs via Google Console !
      ```
   
   3. Add your database connection variables via the terminal
      ```bash
      echo "MONGODB_URI='your_connection_string'" >> .env         # ! replace 'your_connection_string' with your MongoDB connection string !
      echo "DB_PASSWORD='your_password'" >> .env                  # ! replace 'your_password' with your postgreSQL password !
       ```
   4. Optional: Customize your server host address and port
      ```bash
      echo "SERVER_PORT='your_port'" >> .env                 # ! replace 'your_port' with your desired port number !
      echo "LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS='your_host'" >> .env                     # ! replace 'your_host' with your desired IP address !
      ```
 

6. Start the app
   
   1. Start your backend: 
      ```bash
      cd server   
      npm run dev       
      cd ..             # ! navigates back to root directory !
      ```
      or if you prefer nodemon and have it installed
      ```bash
      cd server   
      npm run devN      
      cd ..             # ! navigates back to root directory !
      ```
      
      **NOTE**: You should see messages logged to your console confirming your connection to the database and your server
   
   3. Start your frontend: Open a new terminal window and run the following code from your current directory (`/server`)
      ```bash
      cd ..            # ! navigates back to root directory !
      cd client
      npm run start
      ```
  
      The app is run with expo, which allows you to run the app on the web, via mobiles devices (Android & iOS) or on mobile simulators via your computer. You can change          the environment in the terminal as shown below:
  
      ![expo environment settings](./assets/starting-client.png)
  
      1. Web: Your editor should prompt you to open the app in the browser or simply enter click on the link in the terminal
      2. Mobile
         - iPhones: Scan the QR code in the terminal
         - Android: Install the expo app on your device and scan the QR code via the app.
           **Note**: If you have troubles connecting, check that your network connection is set as 'private' or use a tunnel service to connect between computer and your               device by running in your terminal `expo start --tunnel` to start the app client-side
      3. Computer
         - iOS (for iPhone): Follow the [Expo Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) to set up the iOS simulator
         - Windows (for Android): Follow the [Expo Guide](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/#install-watchman-and-jdk) to set up the Android simulator

      **Note**: The work was mostly done on iOS mobile, so some features may not work or fit properly in on Android or Web.
